            Today we are going to look at Object Pronouns.
            Object pronouns are me, you, him, her, it, us, them, 
            They come after the verb. They are the object or preposition of the verb.   
            First-person object pronouns 'me' and 'us' refer to the speaker.
            Tell me a good joke.
            My brother knows me very well.
            They left us at the park.
            Our teacher gives us a lot of homework.
            Second-person object pronoun 'you' refers to the listener.  
            I like watching movies with you.
            I will call you tomorrow.
            She isn't interested in you.
            They think you are weird.
            Third-person object pronouns 'him', 'her', 'it', 'them' refer to a person, a thing, people, or things.
            Kate likes Dorreen. She sees her every day.
            My teacher is French. I don't understand him.
            That light doesn't work. I think I broke it.
            They are very interesting. I will tell them.           
            I hope you enjoy the lesson.
